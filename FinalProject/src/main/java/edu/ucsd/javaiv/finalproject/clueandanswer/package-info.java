/**
 * This package contains all implementation necessary to run a joke server for jokes that are 
 * specifically "clue-and-answer" jokes. 
 * <p>
 * In contrast to "one-liners", some jokes are not told in one pass, and are instead composed of
 * multiple parts which are delivered in a specific sequence. Generally any joke with a "setup" 
 * and a "punchline" would necessitate this implementation.
 * <p>
 * Typically these jokes also require some degree of participation by the joke's recipient. This 
 * intelligence is <b>not</b> captured in this package in order to keep it as generic as possible.
